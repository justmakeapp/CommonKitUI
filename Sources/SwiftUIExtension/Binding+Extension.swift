    ///
    /// This allows for one-line use of optional bindings, which is very useful for CoreData types
    /// which are non-optional in the model schema but which are still declared nullable and may
    /// be nil at runtime before an initial value has been set.

    /// - note: From experimentation, it seems that a binding created from an `@State` variable
    /// is not immediately 'writable'. There is seemingly some work done by SwiftUI following the render pass
    /// to make newly-created or assigned bindings modifiable, so simply assigning to
    /// `source.wrappedValue` inside `init` is not likely to have any effect. The implementation
    /// has been designed to work around this (we don't assume that we can unsafely-unwrap even after
    /// assigning a non-`nil` value), but a side-effect is that if the binding is never written to outside of
    /// the getter, then there is no guarantee that the underlying value will become non-`nil`.
